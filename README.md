# GoReddit

A Reddit library written for golang

-----------------------------------

This is primarily for use in personal projects. It was started as a
side project so that I could choose the language I wanted to use for a
reddit bot and take more control of how my bot would work. Hopefully
it can be of some use to someone else.
